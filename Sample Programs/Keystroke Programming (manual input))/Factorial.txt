This documents the program for computing the factorial of a number on the HP-16C.
Programmed manually by me (Alex Melnick) on 2024-6-11.


My VoyagerC program that I am converting to HP-16C "assembly" language:
uint32 factorial(uint32 n) {
    uint32 result = 1;

    while (n > 1) {
        result = result * n; // Eventually plan to implement *= operator, but not yet
        n = n - 1; // Eventually plan to implement -- and -= operator, but not yet
    }

    return result;
}


My VoyagerC program converted to MIPS assembly (the only assembly language I know):
.data
    input:  .word 5  # The number to compute the factorial of
    output: .word 0 # The result of the factorial computation
    
.text
    lw $t0, input  # Load the number to compute the factorial of into $t0
    li $t1, 1      # Load the number 1 into $t1 - the result of the factorial computation
    li $t2, 1      # Load the number 1 into $t2 - the number to subtract from $t0
    Loop:
        beq $t0, $t2, Done # If $t0 == 1, then we are done
        mul $t1, $t1, $t0 # Multiply $t1 by $t0 and store the result in $t1
        sub $t0, $t0, $t2 # Subtract 1 from $t0 and store the result in $t0
        j Loop # Jump back to the beginning of the loop
    Done:
        sw $t1, output # Store the result of the factorial computation in output

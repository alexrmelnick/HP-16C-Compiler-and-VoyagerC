# HP-16C Jovial Assembler

The Jovial Assembler is an assembler to assemble a custom assembly programming language into a printable keystroke programming text .pdf or into .16c format for loading directly into the JRPN 16C simulator. 

## Description
The HP-16C is a computer scientist's calculator produced from 1982 until 1989. It is still highly regarded and sought after by assembly programmers. This project aims to provide a user-friendly way to extend the usefulness of the HP-16C by allowing users to write programs in a text editor and assembler them into keystroke programming sequences. The Jovial assembly language is based on the sample programs found in the HP-16C manual. The assembler is written in Python and is designed to be easily extendible to other simulators.

This project started after I received an HP-16C for my birthday. I was absolutely fascinated by the calculator and its programming capabilities. I wanted to write programs for it, but I found the manual programming method to be very cumbersome. I looked online and found various simulators, but none of them offered a connivent way to write programs other than "typing" them in manually. One open-source project, the JRPN 16C simulator, had a human readable format for importing and exporting programs, so I decided to write an assembler targeting it first. This gave me the opportunity to learn about the HP-16C's architecture and assembly capabilities. As well, it gave me to opportunity to contribute to the open-source community.

## Roadmap
### 1. Understand the HP-16C Architecture **(complete)**
- Research HP-16C Specifications:
  - Learn about its memory constraints (203 bytes for program and data).
  - Understand its instruction set and keypress programming method.
  - Study its reverse polish notation (RPN) input method.
### 2. Develop the Jovial Assembler **(complete)**
- Define Assembly Language Syntax:
  - Design a simple assembly language that maps to HP-16C keypress sequences.
  - Define the syntax for arithmetic, logical, and control flow operations.
- Implement Assembler:
  - Develop a tool to parse assembly code and generate HP-16C keystroke sequences.
  - Handle memory constraints and ensure generated code fits within the 203-byte limit.
- Test Assembler:
  - Write assembly programs to test the assemblerâ€™s functionality.
  - Verify that the generated keystroke sequences produce the expected results.
### 3. Write an installer for the Jovial Assembler **(in progress)**
  - Write a script to install the Jovial Assembler on a user's system.
    - Currently it can be manually installed on Windows
    - I would like to make an automated installer and add support for Linux and MacOS.
### 4. Extend the Jovial Assembler to new simulators
  - Add support for Jamie O'Connell's HP-16C Emulator.
  - Add support for the PX16C Kit. 
    - These are both closed source, so this will require either cooperation from the developers or reverse engineering.

## Introduction
VoyagerC is a custom C library designed around the HP-16C calculator. It is intended to be used with the HP-16C Compiler to write programs in C that can be compiled into HP-16C keystroke programming. The VoyagerC library is designed to be easy to use and to provide a familiar programming environment for those who are already familiar with C and the HP-16C calculator.

It is important to note that VoyagerC is not a full implementation of the C programming language. It is a subset of C that has been designed to work with the HP-16C calculator. As such, not all C features are available in VoyagerC. However, VoyagerC does provide a wide range of functions that are specifically designed to work with the HP-16C calculator.

## VoyagerC Library
VoyagerC provides a number of functions that are specifically designed to work with the HP-16C calculator. It contains all of the basic arithmetic and logical functions that are available on the HP-16C. In addition, it provides a number of more advanced functions that are not available on the HP-16C, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentiation. 

## Included HP-16C Functions
The VoyagerC library includes the following functions that are specifically designed to work with the HP-16C calculator:

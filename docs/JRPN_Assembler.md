## Introduction
The JRPN Assembler is a custom assembly language designed specifically for the HP-16C calculator. It is intended to be used with the JRPN HP-16C Simulator to write programs that can be run on the simulator. It is modeled on the HP-16C keystroke programming language provided in the HP-16C manual. The JRPN Assembler is designed to be easy to use and to provide a familiar programming environment for those who are already familiar with the HP-16C calculator.
